		Web APIs - Introduction


		A Web API is a developer's dream.

		It can extend the functionality of the browser
		It can greatly simplify complex functions
		It can provide easy syntax to complex code

		What is Web API?
		API stands for Application Programming Interface.

		A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.
		A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.
		A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.

		Browser APIs
		All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, and to help accessing data.

		For example, the Geolocation API can return the coordinates of where the browser is located.





					AJAX Introduction

			AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

			Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
			Update a web page without reloading the page
			Send data to a web server - in the background


			What is AJAX?
			AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

			AJAX is not a programming language.

			AJAX just uses a combination of:

			A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
			JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
			AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

			AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.





			JSON - Introduction

			JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
			JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
			JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
JSON is used to send data between computers
JSON is language independent *


Why Use JSON?
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:

JSON.parse()

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:

JSON.stringify()


Storing Data
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.

JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
