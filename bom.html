	he Browser Object Model (BOM)
There are no official standards for the Browser Object Model (BOM).

Since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the same methods and properties for JavaScript interactivity, it is often referred to, as methods and properties of the BOM.


The Window Object
The window object represents a window containing a DOM document. A window can be the main window, a frame set or individual frame, or even a new window created with JavaScript.

If you remember from the preceding chapters we've used the alert() method in our scripts to show popup messages. This is a method of the window object.

//Calculating Width and Height of the Window


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Get Browser Viewport Dimensions</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function windowSize(){
        var w = window.innerWidth;
        var h = window.innerHeight;
        alert("Width: " + w + ", " + "Height: " + h);
    }
    </script>
     
    <button type="button" onclick="windowSize();">Get Window Size</button>
</body>
</html>                            




The Screen Object
The window.screen object contains information about the user's screen such as resolution (i.e. width and height of the screen), color depth, pixel depth, etc.

 //Getting Width and Height of the Screen
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Get Screen Resolution</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function getResolution() {
        alert("Your screen is: " + screen.width + "x" + screen.height);
    }
    </script>
     
    <button type="button" onclick="getResolution();">Get Resolution</button>
</body>
</html>    





The Location Object
The location property of a window (i.e. window.location) is a reference to a Location object; it represents the current URL of the document being displayed in that window.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Get Current URL</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function getURL() {
        alert("The URL of this page is: " + window.location.href);
    }
    </script>
     
    <button type="button" onclick="getURL();">Get Page URL</button>
</body>
</html>    


The History Object
The history property of the Window object refers to the History object. It contains the browser session history, a list of all the pages visited in the current frame or window.

Since Window is a global object and it is at the top of the scope chain, so properties of the Window object i.e. window.history can be accessed without window. prefix, for example window.history.length can be written as history.length.

// Getting the Number of Pages Visited
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Get History Length</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function getViews() {
        alert("You've accessed " + history.length + " web pages in this session.");
    }
    </script>
     
    <button type="button" onclick="getViews();">Get Views Count</button>
</body>
</html>



The Navigator Object
The navigator property of a window (i.e. window.navigator) is a reference to a Navigator object; it is a read-only property which contains information about the user's browser.

// Detect Whether the Browser is Online or Offline

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Detect If Browser is Online or Offline</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function checkConnectionStatus() {
        if(navigator.onLine) {
            alert("Application is online.");
        } else {
            alert("Application is offline.");
        }
    }
    </script>
     
    <button type="button" onclick="checkConnectionStatus();">Check Connection Status</button>
</body>
</html>                                                        



JavaScript Dialog Boxes

Creating Dialog Boxes
In JavaScript you can create dialog boxes or popups to interact with the user. You can either use them to notify a user or to receive some kind of user input before proceeding.

You can create three different types of dialog boxes alert, confirm, and prompt boxes.

// Creating Alert Dialog Boxes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Alert Popup Box</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    var message = "Hi there! Click OK to continue.";
    alert(message);
     
    /* The following line won't execute until you dismiss previous alert */
    alert("This is another alert box.");
    </script>
</body>
</html>      


//Creating Confirm Dialog Boxes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Confirm Popup Box</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    var result = confirm("Are you sure?");
 
    if(result) {
        document.write("You clicked OK button!");
    } else {
        document.write("You clicked Cancel button!");
    }
    </script>
</body>
</html>                            



Working with Timers
A timer is a function that enables us to execute a function at a particular time.

Using timers you can delay the execution of code so that it does not get done at the exact moment an event is triggered or the page is loaded. For example, you can use timers to change the advertisement banners on your website at regular intervals, or display a real-time clock, etc. There are two timer functions in JavaScript: setTimeout() and setInterval().

// Executing Code After a Delay

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JavaScript Execute a Function after Some Time</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    function myFunction() {
        alert('Hello World!');
    }
    </script>
     
    <button onclick="setTimeout(myFunction, 2000)">Click Me</button>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Alert popup will be displayed 2 seconds after clicking the button.</p>
</body>
</html>
